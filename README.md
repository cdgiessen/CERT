# ConstExpr RayTracer (CERT)

Behold, the worlds fastest (runtime) raytracer!

Through the power of `constexpr`, we can trace rays in a place that was never meant to ray trace, the compiler.

Currently in a proof of concept state, more features may be added in the future.



## Build Requirements
Requires a C++20 ready compiler to build. Tested with clang-10.
